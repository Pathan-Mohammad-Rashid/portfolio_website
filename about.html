                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <h3>Detailed Information</h3>
                <p>I am Mohammad Rashid Pathan, an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology,
                    Gandhinagar, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

                <p>As a Physically Handicapped Student, my life's mantra is "My abilities are greater than my
                    disabilities." This philosophy fuels my motivation to explore new horizons, maintain a growth
                    mindset, and focus on continuous professional development.</p>

                <p>In this early stage of my engineering journey, I am navigating the realms of Computer Science with a
                    keen sense of curiosity. I am actively engaged in various clubs and initiatives at IITGN. I am on a
                    mission to understand the complexities of different streams in search of my true passion and
                    purpose.</p>

                <p>Despite physical limitations, I enjoy creative activities and exploring unconventional paths. Beyond
                    academia, I indulge in origami-paper folding art, enjoy movies, and immerse myself in informational
                    videos during my free time.</p>

                <p>Through exploration in diverse tech fields such as Quantum Computing, Robotics, Machine Learning,
                    Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, etc. I have found my focal interests to be in machine
                    learning, robotics, and web development. Additionally, my creative flair extends to graphic design
                    and video editing.</p>

                <p>I invite fellow enthusiasts, especially those sharing a similar journey, background, or interests, to
                    connect. Let's engage, collaborate, and foster meaningful connections in our shared pursuit of
                    knowledge and growth. </p>
